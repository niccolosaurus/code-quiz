I started by coding the timer and adding an eventListener so it will start as soon as you click the buton to start the quiz. The timer counts down from 60

When you go through the quiz, each time you answer a question and click next question, the current question is then hidden and a new question appears.
Once you get to the end, the quiz gives you your final score.
